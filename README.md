# Model checker for HyperLTL_2 

HyperLTL is an extension of linear-time temporal logic (LTL)
with first-order quantification of traces.  It can be used
for model-checking of security properties of programs.

This software is a prototype model checker written to accompany 
the Principles of Security and Trust (POST) 2014 paper titled 
"Temporal Logics for Hyperproperties" by Clarkson, Finkbeiner, 
Koleini, Micinski, Rabe, and Sanchez.  The full version of that
paper can be found in an arXiv technical report at: 
  
  http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4492.

The model checker is for a fragment of HyperLTL
that allows one quantifier alternation between forall (A) and
exists (E).  This fragment is called HyperLTL_2.  It was
originally described in another arXiv technical report:

  http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5678

HyperLTL_2 is a syntactic restriction of HyperLTL, which is a logic 
for stating and verifying security hyperproperties of systems.  The 
logic is described in the paper [Temporal Logics for Hyperproperties](http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/~clarkson/papers/clarkson_hyper_tl.pdf)

## Dependencies

You need an OCaml compiler.  An easy way to get one is to
install OPAM, available from:

  http://opam.ocamlpro.com/

Run this command to install some libraries that our model checker depends on:

  opam install xml-light ounit
  
Also install the GOAL toolkit, available at:

    http://goal.im.ntu.edu.tw/wiki/doku.php  
    
Install the Linux/Windows .zip distribution of GOAL, not the Mac .dmg 
distribution.

We tested these instructions with version 4.01.0 of the OCaml compiler, and
with with GOAL2, version 2013-07-11.
  
## Building

To build, run from the src/ directory: 

    make

## Running the model checker

To run the model checker on an input model and formula, run this from the src/
directory:

    ./main.native model_file formula path_to_goal

- model_file is the name of a file containing a Kripke structure.
  Some examples are provided in the test_models/ directory.
- formula_file is a string containing a HyperLTL formula.
  Some examples are provided in the test_formulas/ directory.
  The formula syntax uses a nameless representation of traces,
  as described in the original HyperLTL_2 technical report
  [http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5678].
- path_to_goal is the path to the GOAL runtime as installed 
  on your system.
  
The ultimate output from GOAL will either be (true, null), indicating that
the model satisfies the formula, or (false, ctex), where ctex is a
counterexample showing that model does not satisfy the formula.
  
An invocation on one of the author's machines looks like this:

    $ ./main.native ../test_models/1.mod "A ^ 1 E ^ 1 G ( [T, ~ \"p\"] ^ \"LE\")" ~/Downloads/GOAL-20130123/goal
    Running the model checker with ../test_models/1.mod as the input file..
    Verifying property:
    A ^ 1 E ^ 1 G ( [T, ~ "p"] ^ "LE")
    Model name: ../test_models/1.mod
    Simplified formula: A E ~ (T U (T,p,) v ~ (LE))
    Parsing model...
    The maximally consistent sets are:
    
    ...

    The constructed automaton has 60 states.
    Now to check the formula, we check containment of these two automata
    Written to files...
    Calling GOAL's solver...
    Goal says...
    (true, null)

    Finished checking all properties.
